## Foundation complete base project w/ Grunt compile

A reminder for me of how to set up a good start

### Build Assets

- Install grunt command line tool globally `npm install -g grunt-cli`
- Install project npm packages `npm install`
- Run `grunt` while developing

#### Update Styles Included

To update scss includes see **styles.scss**

*Remember you can name any normal .css to .scss and include it*

#### Update Scripts Included

Edit **scripts.json** and include file to compile and an array of includes referencing lib and bin
